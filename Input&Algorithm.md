## Input Representation & Determining Algorithm

### Input Representation

#### User Input

1. **Target Muscle Group** :
   * Description: The specific muscle group the user intends to train.
   * Type: Text input/Selection from a pre-defined list.
   * Example: "Chest", "Legs", "Back".

By focusing solely on the target muscle group, the system prioritizes the user's primary fitness goal, simplifying the decision-making process.

#### System Inputs

1. **Equipment Status** :
   * Description: Real-time status of each piece of gym equipment (Available/Occupied).
   * Type: Automatically updated by the system.
   * Example: Treadmill - Available, Bench Press - Occupied.
2. **Expected Usage Time** :
   * Description: The expected time each equipment will be in use.
   * Type: Numeric (in minutes), automatically updated.
   * Example: Squat Rack - 20 minutes usage time.

#### Available Equipment List

[Include the full list of gym equipment as previously provided]

### Determining Algorithm

#### Components of the Algorithm

1. **Heuristic Function** :
   * Purpose: To identify the most suitable equipment for the target muscle group, considering equipment availability.
   * Implementation: Factors in equipment usage patterns and current availability.
2. **Optimization Technique** :
   * Selected Algorithms: A* search algorithm, Genetic Algorithm.
   * Purpose: To efficiently match the user's training needs with available equipment, maximizing workout effectiveness.

#### Algorithm Process Flow

1. **Input Processing** :
   * The system receives the user's target muscle group and processes current equipment status and expected usage time.
2. **Heuristic Evaluation** :
   * The heuristic function evaluates available equipment suitable for the target muscle group.
3. **Optimization and Pathfinding** :
   * The optimization algorithm identifies the best sequence of equipment use, focusing on minimizing wait times and maximizing workout relevance.
4. **Output Generation** :
   * The system suggests a sequence of equipment tailored to the target muscle group.
   * Includes equipment names and estimated availability.

### Expected Output

* The output is a user-friendly list of recommended gym equipment, specifically suited for the user's target muscle group.
* The list prioritizes equipment availability, ensuring an efficient workout experience.
